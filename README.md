# MongoDB $inc operator error with string fields
This example demonstrates an error that occurs when using the `$inc` operator with a field that is not a number in MongoDB.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numerical values, attempting to use it on a string field results in an error.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator with a string field. The `updateOne` operation attempts to increment the value of `stringField`, which is of type string, leading to a failure.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the field being incremented is a number (int, double, long) type.  If the field needs to be created and incremented, the initial value should be a number.  Or if converting existing data, perform a conversion to a numerical type before applying the increment.
